- ✅ React with Typescript
- ✅ Storybook integration
- ✅ Deployed at [Vercel](mvst-github-api-challenge.vercel.app) -> best place to host NextJS :)
- ✅ Documented code
- ✅ Tests integrated in storybook

## MVST Exercise Feedback

Task description was partially unclear.  
For me it wasn't clear, if I should create a repo search for repos of one user or for all repositories on github.  
Also regarding the expected UI design I wasn't sure if I need to create a mocked github account like in the video or just the search functionality like I did it.  
And what means: "GitHub repositories are basically just a glorified list" ??

But in general, I liked the task very much because it was very open and you could show a wide range of your skills by using different plugins etc.
